# Sports Ladder

Python scripts for maintaing a sports ladder competition

Generates a random ladder based on an input set of players. Subsequent matches between those players alters the ladder positions.
Player statistics are also generated
Would like to implement a visualisation in the form of some discrete time-series which maps all players' positions.
